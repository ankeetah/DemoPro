# DemoPro
contains practice of problem faced and solved in earlier projects.
folder pro consists of set, arrayList, buffered read, manipulation of object with array.
errorTrails consists of custom made, runtime and checked exception. I have experimented with how the String message was used from the parent class Exception with the integer, check the InputValidator class.
